# FSD: Pages Layer

This directory represents the **`pages`** layer as defined by the [Feature-Sliced Design (FSD)](https://feature-sliced.design/) architecture.

## Purpose in this Project

This folder **is not** used for Next.js file-based routing.

It is intentionally placed in the project root to avoid naming conflicts with the built-in Next.js `app` or `pages` router, which is located at `src/app`.

This directory contains the components that compose full application pages from widgets and features.
