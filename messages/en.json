My initial major was Technological Systems Management (TSM), which had the prerequisite to take Object Oriented Programming class.</paragraph><paragraph>Taking this class changed my life. The more I learned about programming, the more I realized this was what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. That one simple class became a turning point for me. Each line of code was like solving a puzzle, and the sense of accomplishment I felt when a program worked seamlessly was incredibly rewarding. The creative process of building something from scratch, along with the logical problem-solving aspect, sparked a passion that has driven me ever since.</paragraph>",
